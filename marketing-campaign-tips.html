                        <div >
                            <p>After the commercialization of the Internet in the early 1990s, it took very little time for companies to recognize its marketing potential. The first ad appeared on the Internet in 1994, while the period from 1995 to 2000 marked the emergence of a large number of companies trying to take advantage of this rapidly growing technology.</p>
                            <p>As the Internet became the primary means of communication between consumers and vendors — whether it be for sharing information or selling products and services – the need to lead a <a title="5 Effective Social Media Marketing Tips That'll Boost Your Business" href="http://bloggless.com/im/five-key-strategy-tips-social-media-marketing-consistency-customer-service/" target="_self" rel="nofollow">successful online marketing campaign</a> arose.</p>
                            <p>Consequently, in an attempt to increase their website visitors and sales, companies started applying desperate measures in their online campaigns – measures that ultimately harmed their online presence and hindered their progress.</p>
                            <p>Following is a list of 6 most common online marketing mistakes made by companies and website owners, and tips on how to correct them.</p>
                            <h2>Trying to conquer all social media networks</h2>
                            <p><strong>Social Media Marketing (SMM)</strong> helps you get direct feedback from your customers and readers. <a href="http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/18-social-media-marketing-tips/" target="_self" rel="nofollow">Interactive elements of social media</a> give your readers the opportunity to ask questions and discuss various problems, and therefore feel more connected with your business.</p>
                            <p>However, trying to <a title="When Blogging Takes a Wrong Turn" href="http://bloggless.com/im/when-blogging-takes-a-wrong-turn/" target="_self" rel="nofollow">conquer all social media networks</a> at the same time can easily lead to burnout and impact the quality of your content and messages.</p>
                            <p>Each social network meets different social needs. While it is tempting to be present on all social accounts, this is not always the best strategy (unless you have enough time or human resources to enable a strong and satisfying presence).</p>
                            <p>Not giving 100 % of yourself will mean that you are doing a mediocre job of building a social presence and engaging on all networks, instead of focusing on one or two where you will be 100 % effective.</p>
                            <h3>Tips to improve your social presence</h3>
                            <p>—<em>Focus on 2-3 social networks</em> that are most relevant to your market. <a title="Launch Like ProBlogger: 6 Ways To Build Buzz Around Your Blog Post" href="http://bloggless.com/im/launch-like-problogger-6-ways-to-build-buzz-around-your-blog-post/" target="_self" rel="nofollow">Which social network to use</a> depends on the specifics of your business and the goals you want to achieve in terms of marketing.</p>
                            <p>—<em>Consider the functional components</em> of your targeted social networks. For example, if you have an e-commerce site, you can use Twitter for customer support, Facebook for promotion, and Pinterest for visual engagement.</p>
                            <h2>Your website does not meet your visitors’ expectations</h2>
                            <p>When you venture into website development, you have to understand it requires <a href="http://www.successful-blog.com/1/how-to-make-your-blog-stand-out-in-the-crowd/" target="_self" rel="nofollow">continuous work and commitment</a> in order to <a title="How to Get On Top of Google in 2014?" href="http://bloggless.com/im/how-to-get-on-top-of-google-in-2014/" target="_self" rel="nofollow">achieve search engine rankings</a> and grow your business.</p>
                            <p>The main objective of internet marketing is increasing page views and conversions (sales). If your web site is not polished to the teeth, there is a possibility of losing profit, which means your marketing campaign is futile.</p>
                            <h3>Tips for improving your website</h3>
                            <p>— <em>Focus on design</em> and user experience.</p>
                            <p>— <em>Invest in testing</em> the interaction of visitors with the pages on your website.</p>
                            <p>— If your marketing is still not effective enough, <em>examine your offer</em> — there is a possibility the real problem lies in a badly constructed offer.</p>
                            <h2>Your involvement lacks consistency</h2>
                            <p>Many companies and website owners fail to establish regularity in their marketing campaigns, which can lead to customers not visiting their site for a long time.</p>
                            <h3>Tips for improving your involvement</h3>
                            <p>— <em>Avoid the strategy</em> where you will be extremely active during one period, and completely inactive during next. For example, people will not follow you on Twitter if they notice your last tweet was 3 months ago.</p>
                            <p>— <em>Do not lose enthusiasm</em> if your fan base is not growing as expected. Test different content at different times to determine where, when, and what to publish, and what suits your target market the best.</p>
                            <p>— <em>The Internet is full of abandoned social media accounts</em> created by companies whose enthusiasm disappeared before they were able to build a real fan base – do not do the same mistake.</p>
                            <h2>Your E-MAIL marketing strategy lacks focus</h2>
                            <p>
                                E-mail marketing can help you reach new customers who want to receive your information or offers. However, before you start with email marketing you need to build a certain circle of trust and offer your visitors a reason to give you their e – mail address.</p>
                            <p><a href="http://www.dmnews.com/email-marketing-still-works/article/323282/" target="_self" rel="nofollow">Email marketing is an extremely useful strategy</a>, but exaggeration may have a negative impact on your subscribers.</p>
                            <h3>Tips for improving your email marketing campaigns</h3>
                            <p>— <em>Build your visitors’ trust</em>. If you want your website visitors to leave you their e – mail address, you have to first convince them they will benefit from it. You need to explain what they will get from you — what are the benefits of joining your list.</p>
                            <p>— <em>Make promotional coupons</em>. To trigger the interest of your visitors you need to offer something. Offer them something free to take off from your website, or a promotional coupon for a first purchase.</p>
                            <p>— <em>Create simple content</em>. Do not send confusing newsletters crammed with colorful offerings or misinformation. Always focus on precise products or services and be sure to insert a clear call to action.</p>
                            <p>— <em>Be honest with your subscribers</em>. Be sure to specify that submitted e-mail addresses will not be given or sold to third parties and that it is safe for them to enroll in your list. Write how often they can expect your newsletter.</p>
                            <p>— <em>Do not buy lists</em>. It is common curtsey to have your contacts voluntarily accept receiving emails from you.</p>
                            <p>— <em>Do not send emails too often</em>. Once a week is enough, but only if you have a new compelling content /offer.</p>
                            <p>— <em>Do not focus only on yourself</em> – create a newsletter that will assist, inform or entertain your readers.</p>
                            <h2>Your SEO efforts outshine your content</h2>
                            <p>Although you should invest a decent amount of time on <a title="7 SEO Mistakes You Don't Know You're Making" href="http://bloggless.com/im/7-seo-mistakes-you-dont-know-youre-making/" target="_self" rel="nofollow">keyword research and on-page SEO</a>, your primary focus should be on the quality of your content. Obsessing yourself with keywords and search engine optimization may diminish the quality of your posts.</p>
                            <h3>Tips on improving the quality of your website</h3>
                            <p>— <em>Make sure your website is interesting</em> to your visitors so that they will come back for more.</p>
                            <p>— <em>Keep your website navigation simple</em> and make sure your visitors can easily find the content they are looking for.</p>
                            <p>— <em>Make sure your website is useful</em> and that your visitors get something in return for the time they spend on your site.</p>
                            <p>— <em>Try to keep your website HTML errors to a minimum</em>.
